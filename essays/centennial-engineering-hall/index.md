Univerity of New Mexico's Centennial Engineering Building opened in Augest of 2010 and was started in 2008. It was built to continue student education in research programs and partnership with other departments.The Engineering Regional Leadership Committee and Associated General Contractors members (Howard Mock, Bob Stamm, Victor Chavez, and Vicki Mora the CEO of AGC) helped to fund the project. The total cost of the building was $17,000,000 with 75,000 square ft and 19,249 feet of labs and lab support room. The Architect is Van H. Gilbert who was also the founder of University of New Mexico’s School of Architecture Dean Council.  

[^note1]:"One of the most important benefits gained from the Endowed Chair is simply its existance and visibilty" (Dr. Jerald Rounds).

The Associated General Contractors (AGC) was founded in 1984 in the Civil Engineering division. They wanted to bring more awareness to the program as well as the construction industry. The goal was to prepare men and women to exceed in thier careers and become involved in New Mexico Projects. From the words of Dr. Jerald Rounds who is a Chair Professor: "One of the most important benefits gained from the Enowed Chair is simply its existance and visibilty." ASG Focuses on real world construction projects to solve, paln and present. They also grow their networking, public speaking, and team building skills.

## What is Engineering? 
Engineering is referred to as “The Branch of science and technology concerned with the design, building, and use of engines, machines, and structures” (Oxford). This career path is a hug part of our society because it has to do with everything in our day-to-day life. There are four major branches of Engineering: Chemical, Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical. From building rockets to designing pharmaceuticals engineers are needed to keep the country to maintain a working economy and boost innovation and growth. The Centennial engineering building focuses on Civil, Construction, and environmental science. Their programs set students up for success for building construction, waterways, and roads.  Built by the company RDF, they made a statement about what this project entails “The Facility includes teaching and research laboratories for high bay structures, concrete, fluid dynamics, pavement, soils, and environmental engineering. The support spaces include an NMR room, soils instrumentation, concrete curing, and trace metals laboratory” (RDF).

       One stated reason for building a men-only dorm is that Hokona Hall could be freed up to be used as a women-only dorm, where they would have supervision "of the best sort".'

## Centennial Engineering Library 
A big part of the Centennial Engineering building is its library. Located out front of the building next to the Computer and Electrical engineering halls. It is a part of UNM’s college of University Libraires and learning sciences. Where they house over three million books as well as electronic resources. Built in 1998  it cost $11,563,446 and is 170,227 square feet built by Dean Hunt and contracted by Page and Wirtz.

Now we have a text box scrolling up over the image. At various points (clearly labled in the following text) **the background image will switch.**

#### Almost done
This is the end of the story, and you should see the text box scroll out of view followed by the background image.
